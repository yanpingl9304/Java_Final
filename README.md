# Java_Final
original idea:
We want to create a bot that search for daily weather info and provide other daily life usages.
Current functions are as follows
==================================================

weather forecast

gets weather forecast info from weather.com, using its api to extract data.

calendar usage

implement google calendar api into our program so that we can modify events just by using the bot.
